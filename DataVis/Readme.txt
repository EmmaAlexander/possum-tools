These Jupyter notebooks allow you to visualise multiwavelength and polarisation data. You may adapt them for your own use, and I have tried to generalise them as much as possible. A typical order to run the notebooks would be:

1) Astroquery multiwavelength download
2) Multiwavelength view
3) Polarisation view
